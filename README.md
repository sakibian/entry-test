   git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Testing with Cypress

This project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing. To run the tests:

1. Make sure the development server is running (`npm start`)
2. In a new terminal, you can run Cypress in two ways:

   ### Open Cypress Test Runner (Interactive Mode)
   ```bash
   npm run cypress:open
   ```
   This will open the Cypress Test Runner UI where you can:
   - Choose your preferred browser
   - See all test files
   - Run tests interactively
   - Watch tests run in real-time

   ### Run Tests in Headless Mode
   ```bash
   npm run cypress:run
   ```
   This will run all tests in the terminal without opening the UI.

   ### Run Tests with Dev Server
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```
   This command will:
   1. Start the development server
   2. Wait for it to be available
   3. Run all Cypress tests
   4. Shut down the server when done
